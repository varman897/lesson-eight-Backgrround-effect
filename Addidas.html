       <p>
        My most favorite clothing company is Addidas<br>
        The reson why it's my favorite is because It sponsers a lot of soccer teams<br>
        One team it sponsers is the Spain National soccer teams<br>
        It's biggest copetitor is Nike which also sponsers soccer teams<br>
        In my opinion it's the best brand ever made<br
